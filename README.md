<p>LUA SAMP UIF Configurator.</p>
<p>This is a lua script that can hide certain elements from showing in UIF SAMP Server.</p>
<p>They include labels, 3D labels, VIP Actors, UIF IP and command text on bottom and score text on top of the screen.</p>

### [Pre-requisites]
1. ASI Loader
2. Moonloader
3. SAMPFuncs
4. mimgui for Moonloader

### [Installation]
Put the __UIF Configurator.lua__ file from this repository to your Moonloader folder.

### [Usage]
![In-game Menu](https://i.imgur.com/G3qpCgD.png)
<p>Use <b>/config</b> in-game to show the configurator.</p>

### [Known issues]
1. Some 3D labels still spawn.
2. Except for the top and bottom overlay text, everything else will not take effect unless you reload the scene. I.E: If you have labels disabled, and decide to see what labels there are in your vicinity, you will have to enable labels, and then teleport somewhere else and come back to where you were to reload them. Same goes for the others.
3. Houses don't have labels. This can probably be fixed as well.
